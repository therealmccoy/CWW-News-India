"Reading is defined as a cognitive process that involves decoding symbols to arrive at meaning. Reading is an active process of constructing meanings of words. Reading with a purpose helps the reader to direct information towards a goal and focuses their attention. Although the reasons for reading may vary, the primary purpose of reading is to understand the text. Reading is a thinking process. It allows the reader to use what he or she may already know, also called prior knowledge. "

This is the definition which Study.com provides for reading.

Webster Merriam says that the word has been in active use since 12th century at least.

An important component of daily reading for a common man is "reading news", and it has been reduced now to a fallacy at most.

There are two facets to this creation of fallacy: 1) the deluge 2) the non-sense.

Deluge is easy to understand; in today's time we are being inundated with troves and shovels of information which we pretend to read, but we don't actually (See the definition of 'reading' provided at the beginning).

And most of the news which we pretend to read or is shovelled down rather to read by vested interests are fake,sponsored or paid news, by those who have an axe to grind with it. So much so that, even the destiny of mightiest nations are now at mercy of floating fake news.

At CWW News India, we have decided to go back to the FIRST PRINCIPLES of NEWS, which is, the news is meant to be READ.

And thus, for the reading pleasure of our readers, we are going to provide them with 'Context', 'Why' and 'What' of each story we write on, which would be curated from a wide different sources.

Filtering out the stories, which we believe matter, by picking out the subtle seen/un-seen, heard/un-heard signals around us and then wrapping them with 'Context, 'Why' and 'What', to deliver a complete package to our readers.

So that you 'Read', what you are reading.
